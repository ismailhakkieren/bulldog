# Changelog

## v1.0.0
#### February 19, 2013

* Updated this file.
* Tweaked `.gitignore`:
	* Added `dev` to ignore list, and then removed it as `dev` will just contain an `index.html` file that might be useful to preview on the live server.
* Finalized `Gruntfile.js` workflow.
* Added grunt-prepprocess and grunt-env.
* Removed links to `.git` files in `package.json` and moved tasks from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`.
* Removed `src.html` and moved `index.html` into `tmpl` folder.
	* `index.html` is now a template used to generate a `dev` and `prod` version of `index.html`.
* A bunch of other minor changes.

#### February 18, 2013

* Removed test build.
* Added `README.md` to build folder.
* Updated `index.html` and `src.html` to include `ad_manager` bits.
